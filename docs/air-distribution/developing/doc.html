<p>At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization) of a cannabis cultivation facility’s maturity, operations related to managing air distribution begin to incorporate digital systems and tools. This stage sees improvements in monitoring and managing environmental conditions, but challenges still persist.</p>

<p>Roles involved in managing air distribution at the Developing stage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cultivation Manager: Oversees the overall cultivation process and is responsible for monitoring and adjusting air distribution as needed to ensure optimal plant growth.</li>
  <li>Grow Technicians: Work directly with the plants and assist in maintaining air distribution systems, monitoring environmental conditions, and implementing changes as directed by the Cultivation Manager.</li>
  <li>HVAC Technician: Responsible for installing, maintaining, and repairing the facility’s air distribution systems, including fans, air conditioners, and dehumidifiers.</li>
  <li>Data Analyst: Collects and analyzes data related to air distribution and environmental conditions to help identify trends, inefficiencies, and opportunities for improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>How people spend their time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cultivation Manager: Monitors environmental data, adjusts air distribution settings, and communicates with the team to ensure proper implementation.</li>
  <li>Grow Technicians: Monitor plant health, implement air distribution adjustments, and perform regular maintenance on air distribution equipment.</li>
  <li>HVAC Technician: Regularly inspects, maintains, and repairs air distribution systems to ensure optimal functionality and energy efficiency.</li>
  <li>Data Analyst: Reviews data collected from air distribution systems, identifies trends, and reports findings to the Cultivation Manager for informed decision-making.</li>
</ol>

<p>Problems faced due to the maturity level at the Developing stage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Limited automation: While basic digitalization has been implemented, full automation of air distribution systems may not yet be in place. This can lead to increased manual intervention and potential for human error.</li>

  <li>Skill gaps: Employees may not be fully trained in using digital systems, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal air distribution management.</li>
  <li>Inefficient processes: Although digital tools are being used, processes may still be inefficient, leading to wasted time and resources.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the Developing stage, the cultivation owner should focus on investing in more advanced digital systems, providing training to employees, and refining processes to improve the management of air distribution and overall operational efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="processes-and-managing-air-distribution-at-developing-stage-basic-digitalization">Processes and Managing Air distribution at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)</h3>

<p>At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization) of a cannabis cultivation facility, the processes and procedures for managing air distribution become more structured and data-driven. However, several problems and issues can still arise organizationally, especially related to air distribution management.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Inconsistent processes: Although digitalization has been introduced, processes may not be fully standardized across the facility. This can lead to inconsistencies in air distribution management, impacting the overall growing environment.</li>
  <li>Partial data availability: Data collected from basic digital systems may be fragmented, making it difficult to have a comprehensive view of air distribution efficiency and effectiveness. This can hinder the decision-making process and lead to suboptimal air distribution management.</li>
  <li>Limited system integration: Different systems used for air distribution management may not be fully integrated, making it challenging to maintain a seamless flow of information and control between them. This can result in inefficient processes and a lack of cohesion in managing air distribution.</li>
  <li>Reactive approach: At this maturity level, the facility may still be reacting to issues rather than proactively managing air distribution. This can lead to delays in addressing air distribution problems, ultimately affecting plant health and yield.</li>
  <li>Training and skill gaps: Staff may not have adequate training or experience in using digital systems and tools for air distribution management, leading to inefficiencies and potential mistakes.</li>
  <li>Incomplete documentation: Processes and procedures related to air distribution management may not be fully documented or updated, making it difficult for staff to follow best practices and maintain consistency across the facility.</li>

  <li>Data storage and accessibility: Data storage solutions at this stage might not be optimal, leading to difficulty in accessing and retrieving historical data.</li>
</ol>

<p>Data systems:</p>

<p>At this level, the data systems may include basic digital tools such as spreadsheets, simple sensors, and standalone monitoring systems. Integration between different systems is limited, resulting in fragmented data and manual efforts to consolidate information.</p>

<p>Data governance:</p>

<p>Data governance at this stage may be less formal, with some protocols in place to ensure data quality and consistency. However, there might be gaps in data governance practices, such as lack of comprehensive data management policies, data security measures, and roles and responsibilities for data stewards.</p>

<p>Data consumption:</p>

<p>Data consumption at this level may still be somewhat manual, with facility staff reviewing and analyzing data regularly. Data-driven decisions are more frequent compared to the Initial stage, but there may still be a reliance on human intuition and experience rather than fully leveraging the data. The frequency of data consumption and its contribution to actionable decisions will vary based on the specific facility and the staff’s ability to manage and interpret the collected data.</p>

<p>Improving data collection, integration, and governance at this stage will enable the facility to make more informed decisions, resulting in better air distribution management and overall operational efficiency.</p>
