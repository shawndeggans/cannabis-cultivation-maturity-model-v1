  <li>Growers/Horticulturists: These individuals are directly involved in managing and maintaining growing media. They monitor parameters like pH, EC, and moisture levels, and ensure that plants receive proper nutrition. They also manage tasks like transplanting, pruning, and training.</li>
  <li>Irrigation Technicians: They work on optimizing irrigation systems and ensuring that growing media receives the proper amount of water and nutrients, according to plant requirements and the cultivation manager’s guidelines.</li>
  <li>Data Analysts: They collect and analyze data related to growing media performance, contributing to data-driven decision-making and identifying opportunities for improvement.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the Defined stage, people fulfilling these roles spend their time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Monitoring growing media parameters and plant health.</li>
  <li>Adjusting and maintaining irrigation and fertigation systems.</li>
  <li>Analyzing data and identifying trends or anomalies.</li>
  <li>Implementing and refining standardized procedures.</li>
