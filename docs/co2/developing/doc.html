<p>At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization) of the Maturity Model, cannabis cultivation facilities have started implementing basic digital tools to help manage various aspects of the operation, including the management of carbon dioxide (CO2). The roles involved in CO2 management at this stage may include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cultivation Facility Manager: This individual oversees the entire operation and ensures that CO2 management is in line with the facility’s objectives.</li>
  <li>Growers or Cultivation Technicians: They are responsible for managing CO2 levels by monitoring the digital systems and making necessary adjustments to maintain optimal levels for plant growth.</li>
  <li>Data Analysts: They analyze the data collected from digital systems and generate insights to help optimize CO2 management.</li>
  <li>Maintenance Team: This team is responsible for maintaining and troubleshooting the digital systems and CO2-related equipment.</li>
</ol>

<p>At the Developing stage, people in these roles spend their time:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cultivation Facility Manager: Allocating resources for CO2 management, implementing digital tools, and setting CO2 management targets and guidelines.</li>
  <li>Growers or Cultivation Technicians: Regularly checking digital monitoring systems to ensure CO2 levels are within the target range and making adjustments as needed, as well as monitoring other environmental factors such as temperature and humidity.</li>
  <li>Data Analysts: Collecting, organizing, and analyzing CO2-related data to identify trends, generate insights, and support decision-making.</li>
  <li>Maintenance Team: Conducting routine maintenance on CO2 monitoring and control equipment, ensuring the accuracy of digital systems, and addressing any technical issues.</li>
</ol>

<p>Problems faced by people at the Developing stage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Insufficient integration of digital tools: While basic digital tools are in place, they may not be fully integrated, leading to inefficient data management and analysis.</li>

  <li>Partial automation: Although some digital tools are used, not all aspects of CO2 management may be automated, requiring manual intervention and increasing the likelihood of human error.</li>
</ol>

<p>To mitigate these problems, cultivation facilities at the Developing stage should focus on providing comprehensive training for employees, integrating digital tools more effectively, and exploring opportunities to automate CO2 management processes further. As the facility progresses to higher maturity levels, these challenges will become less significant, leading to more efficient and effective CO2 management.</p>
<h3 id="processes-and-managing--carbon-dioxide-at-developing-stage-basic-digitalization">Processes and Managing  Carbon Dioxide at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)</h3>

<p>At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), cannabis cultivation facilities have implemented basic digital tools for managing carbon dioxide (CO2), but the processes and procedures may still have room for improvement. Some of the problems and issues that can be encountered at this stage include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Incomplete digitalization: While some aspects of CO2 management may have been digitalized, there could still be areas relying on manual processes, leading to potential inefficiencies and increased risk of human error.</li>
  <li>Data silos: Data collected from different digital tools may not be fully integrated, resulting in disjointed information and difficulty in gaining a holistic view of CO2 management efforts.</li>
  <li>Lack of standardization: Processes and procedures related to CO2 management may not be fully standardized across the facility, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies.</li>
