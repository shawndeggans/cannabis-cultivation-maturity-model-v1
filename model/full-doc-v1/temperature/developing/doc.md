### People and Managing Temperature at Developing Stage (Basic Digitalization)

As a cannabis cultivation owner, considering operations at the Developing Stage (Basic Digitalization) maturity level, the management of temperature becomes more streamlined and efficient due to the adoption of basic digital systems and technology. Here's how operations and the roles involved may evolve at this stage:

Roles involved:

1. Cultivation Facility Manager: Oversees the entire facility, ensuring that all systems are functioning effectively, including temperature management.
2. Grow Room Supervisor: Responsible for maintaining optimal environmental conditions in the grow rooms, including temperature, humidity, and lighting.
3. Cultivation Technicians: Assist in maintaining and monitoring the plants and environmental conditions, including temperature.

How these roles spend their time:

1. Cultivation Facility Manager: At this stage, the manager spends less time on manual temperature management, as digital systems have been introduced. Their focus shifts to analyzing data, optimizing processes, and enhancing overall facility performance.
2. Grow Room Supervisor: Supervisors benefit from digital systems that monitor temperature, allowing them to spend more time optimizing other environmental factors, training staff, and ensuring the plants' health.
3. Cultivation Technicians: Technicians can now rely on digital systems to alert them of temperature fluctuations, giving them more time to attend to other plant care tasks and proactive maintenance of the facility.

Problems faced due to the maturity level:

1. Limited integration: Although digital systems have been adopted, they may not be fully integrated with other facility systems, requiring manual intervention to ensure optimal temperature conditions.
2. Learning curve: Staff members need to adapt to new technology and digital tools, which may involve additional training and time spent learning new systems.
3. Data analysis: While digital systems provide more data, the staff may lack the expertise to analyze and interpret this data effectively to improve temperature management and overall facility performance.
4. System maintenance: As new digital systems are introduced, additional resources may be required to maintain and troubleshoot these systems, which can be challenging if there's a lack of technical expertise on-site.
### Processes and Managing Temperature at Developing Stage (Basic Digitalization)

As a cannabis cultivation facility operations manager at the Developing Stage (Basic Digitalization) maturity level, processes and procedures have begun incorporating digital systems to improve efficiency and accuracy in temperature management. However, there are still problems and issues that can be encountered organizationally at this stage:

1. Data silos: Basic digitalization may lead to the creation of data silos, where information is stored separately and not easily accessible by all team members. This can hinder communication and collaboration when it comes to managing temperature.
2. Incomplete integration: Digital systems implemented for temperature management might not be fully integrated with other systems, such as humidity control or lighting. This can create challenges in maintaining optimal growing conditions and make it difficult to pinpoint problems when they arise.
3. System reliability: As the facility relies more on digital systems, any technical issues, software glitches, or hardware failures can have a significant impact on temperature management and overall operations.
4. Training and expertise: Staff members may require training to effectively use new digital tools and systems. A lack of understanding or expertise in using these tools can lead to incorrect data input, misinterpretation of data, or poor decision-making.
5. Data security: With increased reliance on digital systems, the facility must ensure that data is secure and protected from unauthorized access or potential cyber threats.
6. Resistance to change: Some team members may be resistant to adopting new digital systems and processes, which can lead to friction within the organization and slow down the transition to more advanced maturity stages.
7. Limited scalability: Basic digital systems may not be easily scalable, which could create challenges as the facility grows or expands its operations. Upgrading to more advanced systems may require significant investment in time, resources, and personnel.
### Data Attributes for Temperature at Developing Stage (Basic Digitalization)

As a cannabis cultivation facility operations manager at the Developing Stage (Basic Digitalization) maturity level, several data attributes would likely be collected in relation to managing temperature:
