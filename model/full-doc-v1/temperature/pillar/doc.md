## Temperate and Plant Lifecycle

1. Germination:
    - During germination, seeds need a consistent and warm environment to sprout. The ideal temperature for germination is between 68-77°F (20-25°C). This temperature range encourages rapid germination and root development.
2. Cloning:
    - When cloning cannabis plants, maintaining a slightly higher temperature of 72-78°F (22-25°C) is important for promoting root growth. A humidity dome can help maintain stable temperature and humidity levels for clones.
3. Vegetative:
    - During the vegetative stage, cannabis plants require slightly warmer temperatures to promote vigorous growth. The ideal temperature range is 70-85°F (21-29°C) with lights on and 62-72°F (17-22°C) with lights off.
4. Mother plants:
    - Mother plants should be kept in a stable environment with temperatures between 68-77°F (20-25°C) to promote healthy growth and ensure the production of high-quality clones.
5. Pre-flowering:
    - Pre-flowering is a transitional stage between vegetative growth and flowering. Maintain the temperature between 68-77°F (20-25°C) during this stage for a smooth transition and to avoid stressing the plant.
6. Flowering:
    - During the flowering stage, slightly lower temperatures are ideal for promoting dense bud development and the production of terpenes and cannabinoids. Aim for a temperature range of 65-80°F (18-26°C) during the day and 62-72°F (17-22°C) at night.
7. Flush:
    - Flushing the plants before harvest is essential for removing excess nutrients and improving the final product's taste and quality. Maintain the same temperature range as the flowering stage, 65-80°F (18-26°C) during the day and 62-72°F (17-22°C) at night.
8. Harvest (Cutting):
    - The temperature during the cutting process is not as crucial as other stages, but maintaining a stable environment with temperatures between 65-75°F (18-24°C) can help reduce the risk of mold and mildew formation.
9. Drying:
    - Proper temperature during the drying stage is crucial to preserve the quality and potency of the cannabis buds. Aim for a temperature range of 60-70°F (15-21°C) and a humidity level of 45-55%.
10. Curing:
    - During the curing stage, the temperature should be maintained between 60-70°F (15-21°C) with a humidity level of 55-65%. This helps to preserve the terpenes, potency, and overall quality of the cannabis buds.
11. Trimming:
    - The temperature during the trimming process is not as critical as other stages, but maintaining a comfortable working environment for the trimmers is important. Aim for a temperature range of 65-75°F (18-24°C).
12. Packaging:
    - When packaging the final product, store it in a cool, dark environment with temperatures between 60-70°F (15-21°C) and humidity levels around 55-65%. This will help preserve the quality, potency, and shelf life of the cannabis.
