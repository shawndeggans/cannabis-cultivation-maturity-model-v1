### People and Managing Canopy Management at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

As a cannabis cultivation owner at the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), the adoption of basic digital tools and systems has improved the management of Canopy Management. However, there are still challenges that the people involved in these processes face. The roles involved in Canopy Management at this stage may include:

1. Cultivation managers
2. Growers or cultivation technicians
3. Data analysts or administrators

People fulfilling these roles may spend their time on the following tasks:

1. Cultivation managers: Supervising and coordinating Canopy Management tasks, making data-driven decisions based on collected information, and monitoring plant health and growth.
2. Growers or cultivation technicians: Executing Canopy Management tasks, such as pruning, training, and defoliation, monitoring plant growth and health, and reporting relevant data.
3. Data analysts or administrators: Collecting, organizing, and analyzing Canopy Management data, identifying trends and potential areas of improvement, and providing reports to support decision-making.

Problems people can face at this maturity level:

1. Limited digital tools and systems: Although basic digitalization has been adopted, there may still be a lack of advanced tools and systems to streamline Canopy Management tasks and data collection.
2. Inconsistent data collection: Despite the adoption of digital tools, data collection may still be inconsistent, affecting the quality and reliability of the collected data.
3. Partial standardization: While there may be some level of standardization, variations in practices and procedures can still persist, leading to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in Canopy Management.
4. Balancing manual tasks with digital processes: The transition to basic digitalization may require staff to adapt to new tools and systems while still performing manual tasks, leading to potential difficulties in balancing the two.

To address these challenges, it is essential to continue investing in more advanced digital tools and systems, provide training and support for staff, and work towards achieving better standardization and consistency in Canopy Management practices. This will help to improve efficiency, reduce problems faced by staff, and ultimately lead to better outcomes in the cultivation process.
### Processes and Managing Canopy Management at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

As a cannabis cultivation facility operations manager at the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), processes and procedures have started to incorporate digital tools and systems, but there are still challenges in managing Canopy Management at this maturity level. Some of the problems and issues that can be encountered organizationally include:

1. Partially digitized processes: While basic digitalization has been adopted, some processes may still rely on manual, paper-based methods, which can lead to inefficiencies and inconsistencies in Canopy Management.
2. Inadequate standardization: Although some standardization may be in place, variations in practices and procedures can persist, leading to inconsistent results and difficulties in comparing data and outcomes.
3. Limited integration: Digital tools and systems used for Canopy Management may not be fully integrated with other systems in the cultivation facility, leading to difficulties in accessing and sharing data and insights across different departments.
4. Insufficient training and support: Staff may not be fully trained in the use of digital tools and systems, leading to potential mismanagement, inefficiencies, or underutilization of available resources.
