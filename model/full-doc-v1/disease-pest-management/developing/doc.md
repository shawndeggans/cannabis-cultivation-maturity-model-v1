### People and Managing Diseases and Pest control at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization) of maturity, there is a shift towards adopting digital tools and more formalized processes for managing diseases and pest control. The following roles in the cultivation facility may be involved in these efforts:

1. Cultivation manager: The cultivation manager oversees the overall cultivation process, including monitoring and addressing issues related to diseases and pests.
2. Growers or cultivation technicians: These individuals are responsible for the day-to-day care of plants, including monitoring for signs of disease or pest infestations, applying treatments, and reporting any issues.
3. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) specialist: An IPM specialist may be brought in to help develop and implement strategies for preventing and controlling diseases and pests in a sustainable and environmentally friendly manner.

People in these roles may spend their time:

1. Monitoring plant health: Regularly inspecting plants for signs of diseases or pests, and documenting observations using basic digital tools, such as spreadsheets or simple software.
2. Implementing preventive measures: Applying treatments, adjusting environmental conditions, or employing other preventative methods based on established protocols.
3. Training and communication: Ensuring all team members are aware of diseases and pest control protocols and are trained in identifying and addressing issues.
4. Data analysis and reporting: Collecting and analyzing data to track trends in disease and pest populations and the effectiveness of control measures.

Problems faced by people at this maturity level may include:

1. Limited digital tools: Basic digitalization may not provide advanced analytical or automation capabilities, leading to potential inefficiencies in data analysis and decision-making.
2. Inconsistent data quality: As the facility transitions from an ad hoc approach to a more structured system, there may be challenges in ensuring data accuracy and consistency across all processes and team members.
3. Resistance to change: Some team members may be hesitant to adopt new digital tools and processes, which can hinder the effective implementation of disease and pest control strategies.
4. Insufficient expertise: The team may lack the necessary expertise in disease and pest management or the use of digital tools, leading to suboptimal decision-making and control measures.
### Processes and Managing Diseases and Pest control at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), processes and procedures related to managing diseases and pest control are becoming more formalized and structured, leveraging basic digital tools to improve efficiency and effectiveness. However, at this maturity level, there are still several problems and issues that can arise organizationally:

1. Incomplete or unclear protocols: The facility may still be in the process of developing and refining its disease and pest control protocols. This can lead to confusion among team members and inconsistent implementation of control measures.
2. Inadequate training: Staff members may not have received comprehensive training on the new digital tools and protocols, which can result in improper data entry, poor decision-making, and ineffective pest control measures.
3. Limited resources: The facility may be constrained by budget, personnel, or time, making it challenging to fully implement and enforce digitalization in disease and pest control processes.
4. Fragmented data systems: Basic digital tools, such as spreadsheets or simple software, may not be well-integrated or user-friendly, leading to data silos and difficulties in sharing and analyzing information across the organization.
5. Inconsistent monitoring and reporting: The transition to digital systems may create inconsistencies in the frequency and quality of monitoring and reporting, as staff adjust to new processes and tools.
6. Slow adaptation to emerging issues: The basic digital tools in use may not be agile enough to detect and respond to emerging diseases and pests quickly, which can lead to crop losses or reduced quality.
7. Resistance to change: Some team members may be hesitant to embrace new digital tools and processes, which can slow down the implementation and effectiveness of the disease and pest control program.
8. Lack of continuous improvement: The Developing stage often focuses on implementing basic digital tools and may not prioritize continuous improvement or optimization of processes, which can limit the effectiveness of the disease and pest control program in the long run.
### Data Attributes for Diseases and Pest control at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), data attributes that would likely be collected in relation to managing diseases and pest control include:

1. Pest and disease identification: Information on the type of pests and diseases affecting the plants, including species, severity, and affected areas.
2. Treatment and control methods: Data on the specific treatments applied, including chemical or biological agents, application methods, and dosages.
3. Treatment dates and frequencies: Information on when treatments were applied and how often they were repeated.
4. Environmental conditions: Data on factors like temperature, humidity, and light levels that may influence pest and disease prevalence.
5. Monitoring and inspection results: Records of regular inspections, including pest and disease counts, signs of infestation, and overall plant health.
6. Crop yield and quality: Information on the impact of pests and diseases on the quantity and quality of the harvest.

Challenges faced collecting data at this maturity level include:

1. Inconsistent data entry: Staff may not be well-trained in using digital tools or may be inconsistent in entering data, leading to gaps or errors in the information.
2. Limited data integration: Basic digital tools, such as spreadsheets or simple software, may not be easily integrated, leading to data silos and difficulties in sharing and analyzing information across the organization.
3. Data governance issues: Developing stage facilities may lack clear guidelines and policies for data collection, storage, and access, leading to potential data quality and security issues.
4. Manual data processing: Some data collection and analysis tasks may still be performed manually, leading to inefficiencies and potential errors.

At this level, data systems may consist of basic tools like spreadsheets or simple software applications. Data governance may be minimal or informal, with limited oversight and standardization. Data consumption may be inconsistent, with data-driven decisions made on an ad hoc basis rather than as a routine part of the operation. The contribution of data to actionable decisions may be limited by the challenges mentioned above and the lack of advanced analytics capabilities.
### Data Events for Diseases and Pest control at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), events likely to be collected in relation to managing diseases and pest control include:

1. Pest and disease outbreaks: Instances where a new pest or disease is detected in the facility or when an existing problem escalates.
2. Treatment application events: When treatments or control methods are applied to manage pests and diseases.
3. Inspection and monitoring events: Scheduled inspections to assess pest and disease prevalence and the effectiveness of control measures.
4. Threshold exceedances: When pest or disease levels exceed established thresholds, requiring intervention or treatment adjustments.

Challenges faced collecting these events at this maturity level include:

1. Manual event logging: Event information may be recorded manually, leading to inconsistencies, errors, or delays in data entry.
2. Limited real-time data: Basic digital tools may not support real-time data collection and processing, hindering timely decision-making.
