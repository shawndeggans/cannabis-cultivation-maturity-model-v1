<p>At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization) of managing Oxygen and Oxygenation in a cannabis cultivation facility, there is a shift towards adopting digital technology to streamline and optimize operations. Roles involved in managing oxygen and oxygenation at this stage include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Cultivation Manager: This person oversees the entire cultivation process, ensuring that oxygen levels and oxygenation are properly maintained to optimize plant growth and development.</li>
  <li>Growers or Cultivation Technicians: These individuals are responsible for the day-to-day management of plants, including monitoring and adjusting oxygen levels and oxygenation as needed.</li>
  <li>Maintenance Staff: Maintenance personnel ensure that the equipment used for oxygen and oxygenation management is functioning properly and perform any necessary repairs or adjustments.</li>
</ol>

<p>At this stage, people fulfilling these roles might spend their time as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cultivation Manager: They focus on developing and implementing strategies to improve oxygen and oxygenation management, analyzing data collected through digital systems, and coordinating with other departments to maintain optimal conditions for plant growth.</li>
  <li>Growers or Cultivation Technicians: They monitor oxygen levels and oxygenation in real-time using digital tools and adjust the parameters as needed. They also perform routine checks and maintenance of oxygen-related equipment, and ensure the facility is adhering to the standard operating procedures.</li>
  <li>Maintenance Staff: They perform regular checks on the equipment, repair or replace malfunctioning components, and provide support to growers or cultivation technicians in case of equipment-related issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the adoption of basic digitalization, challenges may still arise for the people working at this maturity level:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Inadequate digital systems: While basic digital systems have been implemented, they may not provide a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing oxygen and oxygenation. This can lead to inefficiencies and potential issues with plant growth.</li>
  <li>Training and adaptation: Employees may require training to effectively utilize the new digital systems and tools, and they may face a learning curve in adapting to the new processes.</li>
  <li>Data management and interpretation: While data is now being collected digitally, there may still be challenges in managing, analyzing, and interpreting the data to make informed decisions regarding oxygen and oxygenation management.</li>
  <li>Limited automation and integration: At this stage, automation may still be limited, and systems may not be fully integrated. This can result in manual intervention and coordination between different departments, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.</li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, at the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), the adoption of digital technology to manage Oxygen and Oxygenation has improved operations but still presents challenges, including inadequate digital systems, training and adaptation, data management and interpretation, and limited automation and integration.</p>
<h3 id="processes-and-managing-oxygen-and-oxygenation-at-developing-stage-basic-digitalization">Processes and Managing Oxygen and Oxygenation at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)</h3>

<p>As a cannabis cultivation facility operations manager at the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), processes and procedures are gradually becoming more streamlined, thanks to the implementation of digital tools and systems. However, there are still challenges that can arise organizationally, especially related to managing Oxygen and Oxygenation:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Incomplete digital transformation: At this stage, some processes may still be manual or only partially digitized, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies in managing oxygen and oxygenation. This can impact the overall performance and quality of the cannabis plants.</li>
  <li>Standardization of processes: Although digital tools have been implemented, the facility may still be working towards standardizing processes and procedures. This can lead to variations in how oxygen and oxygenation are managed, affecting the uniformity of the plants and overall productivity.</li>
  <li>Limited scalability: The digital systems and tools implemented at this stage may not be designed for scalability, making it difficult to expand operations or adapt to changing requirements effectively.</li>
  <li>Data silos: Basic digitalization may result in data silos, where information is not easily accessible or shared across different departments. This can hinder effective decision-making and collaboration in managing oxygen and oxygenation levels.</li>
  <li>Integration issues: The digital systems in place may not be fully integrated with each other or with existing equipment, resulting in manual intervention and potential errors in data collection and management.</li>
  <li>Resource allocation: Balancing resources between maintaining existing manual processes and investing in further digital transformation can be challenging at this stage. This can result in a slower pace of improvement and limited advancements in oxygen and oxygenation management.</li>
  <li>Training and skill gaps: Employees may require additional training to effectively use the digital tools and systems implemented at this stage. Skill gaps may also arise as the facility transitions towards more advanced digital technologies.</li>
</ol>

<p>In summary, at the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), while processes and procedures are beginning to benefit from the implementation of digital tools and systems, there are still challenges organizationally, such as incomplete digital transformation, standardization issues, limited scalability, data silos, integration issues, resource allocation, and training and skill gaps. These factors can impact the efficiency and effectiveness of managing Oxygen and Oxygenation within the facility.</p>
