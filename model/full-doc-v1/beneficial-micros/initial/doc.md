### People and Managing Beneficial Microorganisms at Initial stage (Ad hoc)

At the Initial stage (Ad hoc) of cannabis cultivation, operations are primarily reactive and lack a structured approach to managing beneficial microorganisms. In this stage, the roles involved in working with or managing beneficial microorganisms may include the following:

1. Cultivation owner: The owner oversees the overall operations and makes decisions about cultivation practices, including the use of beneficial microorganisms.
2. Cultivation manager or head grower: This person is responsible for managing the cultivation process and may be involved in applying beneficial microorganisms to the plants or growing medium.
3. Cultivation technicians or growers: These individuals handle the day-to-day plant care, including watering, feeding, and potentially applying beneficial microorganisms.

At this maturity level, people fulfilling these roles may face several challenges:

1. Lack of knowledge: A limited understanding of the role of beneficial microorganisms in cannabis cultivation may lead to inconsistent or incorrect application, which can impact plant health and yield.
2. Inconsistent application: Without a structured approach, the application of beneficial microorganisms may be sporadic or inconsistent, leading to suboptimal results.
3. Time management: As the cultivation process is primarily reactive, individuals may spend more time addressing issues that arise from improper management of beneficial microorganisms, such as nutrient deficiencies or disease outbreaks.
4. Limited resources: The cultivation facility may have limited resources, making it difficult to invest in beneficial microorganisms or the equipment required for their proper application.

In summary, at the Initial stage (Ad hoc) of cannabis cultivation maturity, the roles involved in managing beneficial microorganisms include the cultivation owner, cultivation manager, and cultivation technicians. These individuals may face challenges due to a lack of knowledge, inconsistent application, time management issues, and limited resources, which can impact overall plant health and yield.
### Processes and Managing Beneficial Microorganisms at Initial stage (Ad hoc)

As a cannabis cultivation facility operations manager at the Initial stage (Ad hoc) maturity level, the processes and procedures for managing beneficial microorganisms are often informal and inconsistent. This can lead to several organizational problems and issues:

1. Lack of standard operating procedures (SOPs): In the absence of documented procedures, the cultivation team may apply beneficial microorganisms inconsistently or improperly, which can negatively impact plant health and yield.
2. Inadequate training: Without formal training on the use of beneficial microorganisms, employees may not understand their importance or how to apply them effectively, leading to suboptimal results.
3. Reactive approach: The cultivation facility may respond to problems as they arise, rather than proactively managing beneficial microorganisms to prevent issues such as pest infestations or nutrient deficiencies.
4. Limited knowledge sharing: With no formal processes in place, knowledge about beneficial microorganisms may be confined to a few individuals, which can hinder the team's overall ability to manage these organisms effectively.
5. Inefficient use of resources: Without a clear understanding of the benefits of microorganisms and their proper application, the cultivation facility may invest in unnecessary treatments or neglect to incorporate beneficial microorganisms into their cultivation practices.
6. Difficulty in identifying and resolving issues: The lack of structured processes for managing beneficial microorganisms can make it challenging to pinpoint the root cause of problems when they arise, leading to longer resolution times and potential damage to the plants.

In summary, at the Initial stage (Ad hoc) maturity level, the processes and procedures for managing beneficial microorganisms are informal and inconsistent, leading to a variety of organizational problems. These include a lack of SOPs, inadequate training, a reactive approach to problem-solving, limited knowledge sharing, inefficient use of resources, and difficulty in identifying and resolving issues related to plant health and cultivation.
