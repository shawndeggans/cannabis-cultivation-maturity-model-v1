### People and Managing Beneficial Microorganisms at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), cannabis cultivation facilities have begun to implement basic digital tools and processes for managing Beneficial Microorganisms. The operations for people working at this maturity stage will be more structured than at the Initial stage (Ad hoc), but still have room for improvement.

Roles in the cultivation facility involved in managing Beneficial Microorganisms include:

1. Cultivation Manager: Oversees the overall cultivation process, including the application of Beneficial Microorganisms.
2. Grow Technicians: Assist with the day-to-day management of plants and the application of Beneficial Microorganisms.
3. IPM (Integrated Pest Management) Specialist: Develops and manages pest control strategies, including the use of Beneficial Microorganisms.
4. Data Analyst: Collects and analyzes data related to Beneficial Microorganisms to identify trends and areas for improvement.

How people fulfilling these roles spend their time:

1. Cultivation Manager: Monitoring the overall cultivation process, ensuring the proper use of Beneficial Microorganisms, and making decisions based on available data.
2. Grow Technicians: Applying Beneficial Microorganisms, monitoring their effects on plants, and reporting results to the Cultivation Manager.
3. IPM Specialist: Developing and refining pest management strategies, researching new Beneficial Microorganisms, and training staff on their proper use.
4. Data Analyst: Collecting and analyzing data from digital tools, preparing reports, and identifying trends or issues related to Beneficial Microorganisms.

Problems faced by people working at this maturity level:

1. Limited digital tools and capabilities: While basic digitalization has been implemented, the tools available may still be limited or not fully integrated, which can lead to inefficiencies and difficulties in tracking and analyzing data.
2. Resistance to change: Some team members may be resistant to adopting new digital tools or processes, which can hinder the effective management of Beneficial Microorganisms.
3. Incomplete knowledge: While there may be more knowledge about Beneficial Microorganisms at this stage, there could still be gaps in understanding their optimal use, leading to suboptimal results.
4. Insufficient training: Staff may not have received adequate training on the proper use of Beneficial Microorganisms or digital tools, which can result in mistakes and inefficiencies.

At the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), the management of Beneficial Microorganisms is more structured, but there are still challenges related to limited digital tools, knowledge gaps, and staff training.
### Processes and Managing Beneficial Microorganisms at Developing stage (Basic digitalization)

As a cannabis cultivation facility operations manager at the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), processes and procedures for managing Beneficial Microorganisms are more structured compared to the Initial stage (Ad hoc), but still face various challenges.

1. Inconsistent documentation: While digital tools have been introduced for recording information, there may be inconsistencies in how data is documented across different team members, leading to inaccurate or incomplete information.
2. Inadequate standard operating procedures (SOPs): There may be a lack of well-defined SOPs for the application and management of Beneficial Microorganisms. This can lead to inconsistencies in their usage and affect the overall health and yield of the plants.
3. Limited integration between digital tools: Basic digitalization might include multiple tools that are not fully integrated with each other, causing difficulties in consolidating and analyzing data for informed decision-making.
4. Insufficient monitoring and evaluation: There might be a lack of robust monitoring and evaluation systems to assess the effectiveness of Beneficial Microorganisms and their impact on plant health and yield, making it challenging to optimize their usage.
5. Suboptimal pest management strategies: The facility may still rely on more traditional pest management approaches, rather than fully leveraging the potential of Beneficial Microorganisms as part of an integrated pest management strategy.
6. Slow adoption of new technology: The organization may face resistance in adopting new digital tools and technology, leading to delays in implementing more efficient processes and procedures for managing Beneficial Microorganisms.

To address these challenges at the Developing stage (Basic digitalization), the cultivation facility operations manager should focus on improving documentation consistency, developing clear SOPs, integrating digital tools, enhancing monitoring and evaluation systems, optimizing pest management strategies, and fostering a culture that embraces technological advancements.
