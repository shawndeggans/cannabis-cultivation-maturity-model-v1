### People and Managing  Irrigation and Fertigation at Initial stage (Ad hoc)

At the Initial stage (Ad hoc) of cannabis cultivation, operations related to irrigation and fertigation are typically less structured and more reactive. The people involved in managing irrigation and fertigation at this maturity level may face several challenges due to the lack of standardized processes and technology.

Roles involved:

1. Cultivation owner: The owner may be directly involved in making decisions related to irrigation and fertigation, particularly in smaller operations.
2. Cultivation manager: This person oversees the entire cultivation process, including managing irrigation and fertigation schedules and strategies.
3. Growers or cultivation technicians: These individuals are responsible for the hands-on execution of irrigation and fertigation tasks, such as watering plants and mixing nutrient solutions.

How people spend their time:

1. Cultivation owner: The owner may spend time researching best practices for irrigation and fertigation, making decisions on an ad hoc basis, and troubleshooting issues as they arise.
2. Cultivation manager: The manager allocates time to planning and adjusting irrigation and fertigation schedules, monitoring plant health, and training staff on the execution of these tasks.
3. Growers or cultivation technicians: Technicians spend their time watering plants, preparing nutrient solutions, and monitoring plant health, often using manual methods and making adjustments as needed.

Problems faced at the Initial stage (Ad hoc):

1. Inconsistency: Without standardized processes and technology, irrigation and fertigation schedules can be inconsistent, leading to variable plant health and overall crop quality.
2. Lack of documentation: The absence of proper record-keeping can make it difficult to track and analyze the impact of irrigation and fertigation strategies on plant growth and development.
3. Inefficient use of resources: Manual methods for irrigation and fertigation can lead to over- or under-watering, as well as nutrient imbalances, which can negatively impact plant health and yield.
4. Limited scalability: Ad hoc processes can be difficult to scale as the operation grows, potentially leading to bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the cultivation process.
5. Inadequate knowledge and training: Without access to expert knowledge or formal training, staff may lack the skills needed to effectively manage irrigation and fertigation, potentially resulting in suboptimal plant growth and development.

### Processes and Managing Irrigation and Fertigation at Initial stage (Ad hoc)

At the Initial stage (Ad hoc), processes and procedures related to managing irrigation and fertigation in a cannabis cultivation facility are often unstructured and improvised, which can lead to various organizational problems and issues.

1. Lack of standardization: Without well-defined processes and procedures in place, managing irrigation and fertigation can be inconsistent, leading to variability in plant health and crop quality. This lack of standardization can make it difficult to replicate successes or learn from failures.
2. Inefficient resource utilization: The absence of formal processes may result in the inefficient use of water and nutrients, leading to waste and higher operating costs. Additionally, plants may experience over- or under-watering and nutrient imbalances, affecting overall growth and yields.
3. Limited scalability: Ad hoc processes are difficult to scale as the operation grows, potentially leading to bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and an inability to meet increasing demand.
4. Reactive decision-making: Without formal processes in place, decisions regarding irrigation and fertigation may be made reactively, based on immediate needs or issues. This short-term focus can lead to suboptimal long-term outcomes and hinder the operation's ability to optimize its irrigation and fertigation strategies.
5. Inadequate documentation and data tracking: The lack of formal processes and procedures may result in insufficient record-keeping, making it challenging to analyze the effectiveness of different irrigation and fertigation approaches and identify areas for improvement.
6. Increased risk of human error: Relying on manual methods for irrigation and fertigation increases the likelihood of mistakes, which can have significant consequences for plant health and overall crop quality.
7. Difficulty in training and knowledge transfer: The absence of standardized processes can make it challenging to train new staff members or transfer knowledge effectively, potentially leading to inconsistencies in how irrigation and fertigation tasks are carried out.
8. Limited access to expert knowledge: Without formal processes in place, the cultivation facility may not have access to the latest research or best practices related to irrigation and fertigation, hindering its ability to implement effective strategies and stay competitive in the market.

### Data Attributes for Irrigation and Fertigation at Initial stage (Ad hoc)

At the Initial stage (Ad hoc), data collection related to managing Irrigation and Fertigation in a cannabis cultivation facility is likely to be minimal and informal, with several challenges and limitations:

1. Limited data attributes: The data collected at this stage may only include basic information such as the amount of water and nutrients applied, frequency of irrigation, and visual observations of plant health. Comprehensive data on factors like soil moisture levels, nutrient concentrations, or environmental factors may not be tracked.
2. Inconsistent data collection: The lack of standardized processes may result in irregular and inconsistent data collection, making it difficult to establish trends, identify patterns, or compare data over time.
3. Manual data recording: At this maturity level, data is likely recorded manually, using paper records or basic spreadsheets. This approach can be prone to human error and may not capture all relevant information.
4. Data accessibility: Data may be stored in disparate locations or formats, making it challenging to consolidate and analyze. This can hinder the ability to make data-driven decisions and identify areas for improvement.
5. Data governance: At this level, data governance is likely minimal or non-existent. There may be no clear policies or procedures for data collection, storage, or sharing, leading to potential inconsistencies or data quality issues.
