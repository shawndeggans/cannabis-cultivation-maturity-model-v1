Radiation or lighting plays a crucial role in the growth and development of cannabis plants throughout their life cycle. Each stage has specific lighting requirements to ensure optimal growth, health, and yield. Here's a breakdown of how lighting relates to each stage of the plant life cycle:

1. Germination: During germination, seeds require a warm, moist environment to sprout. Low light levels or indirect light is sufficient for this stage, as the primary focus is on the development of roots and the initial sprout.
2. Cloning: Clones, or cuttings taken from a mother plant, need a high level of blue light to stimulate root growth and prevent stretching. A consistent 18 to 24 hours of light exposure is recommended, with lower intensity than the vegetative stage.
3. Vegetative: In the vegetative stage, plants focus on building strong root systems and leafy growth. Cannabis plants need intense, full-spectrum lighting with a higher proportion of blue light to promote compact, bushy growth. A typical light schedule for this stage is 18 hours on and 6 hours off.
4. Mother: Mother plants are used for cloning and should be kept in a constant vegetative state. Similar to the vegetative stage, they require full-spectrum lighting with a higher proportion of blue light. An 18-hour light and 6-hour dark cycle is maintained to keep the plants healthy and ready for cloning.
5. Pre-flowering: During the pre-flowering stage, plants transition from vegetative growth to flowering. Lighting requirements change, with an increased emphasis on red light to stimulate bud formation. The light schedule also changes to a 12-hour on and 12-hour off cycle to induce flowering.
6. Flowering: The flowering stage is when plants develop buds and produce cannabinoids. High-intensity, full-spectrum lighting with a greater proportion of red light is needed to promote optimal bud growth and development. The 12-hour light and 12-hour dark cycle is maintained throughout the flowering stage.
7. Flush: During the flush stage, plants are given water without nutrients to remove excess salts and nutrients from the growing medium. Lighting remains the same as in the flowering stage, with a 12-hour on and 12-hour off cycle.
8. Harvest (Cutting): Lighting is less critical during the actual process of cutting the plants for harvest, as the focus is on the physical removal of the buds and leaves from the plants.
9. Drying: After harvest, cannabis buds need to be dried in a dark, cool, and well-ventilated space. No lighting is necessary during this stage, as exposure to light can degrade cannabinoids and terpenes.
10. Curing: Curing further improves the quality and potency of dried buds. The process involves storing the buds in airtight containers in a cool, dark place. Light exposure should be minimized during curing to preserve the quality of the final product.
11. Trimming: Trimming is the process of removing excess leaves and stems from the dried buds. Lighting is not critical during this stage, as the focus is on manual handling and processing.
12. Packaging: During packaging, cannabis products are prepared for sale or consumption. While lighting is not directly related to this stage, it is important to store packaged products in a cool, dark place to preserve their quality and potency.

In summary, radiation or lighting plays a vital role in the growth and development of cannabis plants throughout their life cycle. Each stage has specific lighting requirements to ensure optimal growth, health, and yield. By understanding and adjusting lighting conditions for each stage, cultivators can optimize their cannabis production process.
