This is V1 of the GrowerInTheLoop.com Cannabis Cultivation Maturity Model

## What is the GrowerInTheLoop.com Cannabis Cultivation Maturity Model?
The GrowerInTheLoop.com Cannabis Cultivation Maturity Model is a framework for assessing the maturity of a cannabis cultivation operation.  It is based on the primary pillars required to grow good cannabis and the basic maturity levels of initial, developing, defined, managed, and optimized. The goal of this model is to help cannabis cultivation professionals understand where they are in their journey to growing good cannabis and what they need to do to get to the next level.

## How do I use the GrowerInTheLoop.com Cannabis Cultivation Maturity Model?
GrowerInTheLoop.com will provide a survey that will allow you to assess your operation against the maturity model.  The survey will provide you with a score for each pillar and an overall maturity level for your operation.  The report from this survey will also provide you with a list of recommendations for how to improve your maturity level. This is still under developmment.

## What are the pillars of the GrowerInTheLoop.com Cannabis Cultivation Maturity Model?
Right now there are fourteen different plant pillars. This could change over time with newer versions of the Maturity Model Framework, but we believe we’ve captured the primary essence of what the plant needs to flourish under the care of a grower.

1. Temperature:
    - Temperature control is important for indoor cannabis growth, and the ideal temperature range varies depending on the stage of growth. The temperature range should be between 68-77°F during the day and 62-72°F at night.
2. VPD:
    - VPD, or vapor pressure deficit, is a measure of the humidity in the grow room. Maintaining the correct VPD is important for optimal plant growth and development. The ideal VPD range is between 0.8-1.3 kPa during the vegetative stage and 1.3-1.8 kPa during the flowering stage.
3. Carbon Dioxide:
    - Carbon dioxide (CO2) is essential for plant growth, and indoor growers often supplement the air with additional CO2 to increase plant growth rates. The ideal CO2 level for cannabis growth is between 1000-1500 ppm.
4. Radiation or Lighting:
    - Light is a crucial factor in indoor cannabis growth. The use of HID (High-Intensity Discharge) lamps is recommended for optimal growth and yields, but LED may be preferred based on your region and budget. The ideal light spectrum for cannabis growth is between 400-700 nm, which is the range of light that plants use for photosynthesis.
5. Air distribution:
    - Air circulation and distribution are important to maintain fresh air and prevent the buildup of humidity, which can lead to mold growth. Fans and exhaust systems can be used to circulate air and maintain proper airflow.
6. Water:
    - Water is an essential component of cannabis growth, and growers should ensure that their plants receive adequate water throughout the growing process. Overwatering and underwatering should be avoided.
7. Nutrition and Fertilization:
    - Proper nutrition and fertilization are crucial for cannabis growth. Nutrient deficiencies or excesses can cause stunted growth or reduced yields. Growers should use fertilizers designed for cannabis plants and follow recommended feeding schedules.
8. Irrigation and Fertigation:
    - Irrigation and fertigation systems are important for consistent watering and fertilization of plants. Automatic systems can be used to deliver water and nutrients at regular intervals.
9. Growing Media:
    - Choosing the right growing media is important for cannabis growth. Soil, coco coir, and hydroponic systems are all viable options. Growers should ensure that the growing media has adequate drainage and nutrient-holding capacity.
10. Beneficial Microorganisms:
    - Beneficial microorganisms can be used to enhance plant growth and protect against pests and diseases. These microorganisms can be added to the growing media or applied as foliar sprays.
11. Oxygen and Oxygenation:
    - Oxygen is essential for root health, and growers should ensure that their plants receive adequate oxygenation. Air stones and other oxygenation systems can be used to increase oxygen levels in hydroponic systems.
12. Rootzone care:
    - Rootzone care is essential for plant growth, and growers should ensure that their plants have adequate room to grow and develop healthy root systems. Regular pruning and transplanting can be used to promote healthy root growth.
13. Canopy Management:
    - Canopy management involves controlling the height and width of the plant canopy to promote optimal growth and yield. Techniques such as topping, pruning, and training can be used to manage the canopy.
14. Diseases and Pest control:
    - Indoor cannabis plants are susceptible to pests and diseases, and growers should take measures to prevent and control infestations. Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies, such as using beneficial insects and applying organic pesticides, can be effective in controlling pests and diseases.

## What are the maturity levels of the GrowerInTheLoop.com Cannabis Cultivation Maturity Model?
For each of the plant pillars, we break them down into maturity stages. This isn’t the maturity of the plant, but the maturity by which the grower or facility approaches this area of care. This is broken down more, but for illustration here is the best way to think of these levels of maturity applied to an overall cultivation facility:

1. Initial stage (Ad hoc):
    - In this stage, cannabis cultivators have little or no technology adoption. Processes are primarily manual, and there's limited use of digital tools for tracking and managing cultivation. Data collection and analysis are also minimal or non-existent.
2. Developing stage (Basic digitalization):
    - At this stage, cultivators begin to adopt basic digital tools, such as spreadsheets and simple software applications, for tracking cultivation processes and managing their business. Data collection is more organized, but data analysis capabilities are still limited.
3. Defined stage (Intermediate technology adoption):
    - Cannabis cultivators in this stage have implemented more sophisticated technology solutions, such as integrated cultivation management systems, sensors, and automation tools. Data analysis is more advanced, and cultivators start to use data-driven insights for decision-making.
4. Managed stage (Advanced technology adoption):
    - In this stage, cultivators have embraced advanced technologies like IoT, artificial intelligence, and machine learning to optimize their cultivation processes. They are using data analytics and predictive modeling to make strategic decisions, and there's a strong focus on continuous improvement and innovation.
5. Optimizing stage (Cutting-edge technology adoption):
    - At the highest level of maturity, cultivators are leveraging cutting-edge technologies like robotics, advanced AI, and blockchain for supply chain management. They continuously innovate and optimize their processes, staying at the forefront of the industry.
